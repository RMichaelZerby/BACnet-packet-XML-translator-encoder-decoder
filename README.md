# BACnet-packet-XML-translator-encoder-decoder

The code is C# written with a free version of Visual Studio and is now ported to the community edition.

The Project date back several years 2014 when I was looking to work with BACnet technology

This was a work in progress and was intended to study and translate the BACnet Stack (packet) to XML and back into the raw packet format

I have decided to open source the work

Running the module named TestTheBasics.cs will run through a series of translations that encoding and decoding the BACnet data

IEEE 754 Floating-Point Arithmetic translating are found in BACVnetfloatingpointmath.cs
